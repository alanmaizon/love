          The Greatest Gift is Your Love and Presence
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our journey together has been one of love, laughter, and countless unforgettable moments.
          From the first time we met to the adventures we've shared, every step has brought us closer
          to this incredible milestone. On April 26, 2025, we will say "I do" and begin a new chapter as
          husband and wife, surrounded by the people who mean the most to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your love, support, and presence on our wedding day are the greatest gifts we could ever receive.
          However, if you wish to contribute in another way, we have created this space with meaningful options.
          Instead of traditional gifts, we want our marriage to be an opportunity to give back. That's why we
          have chosen three charitable organizations that inspire us and reflect the values we share. Any donation,
          big or small, will be a beautiful way to celebrate our union.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being part of our journey and for helping us make love something that extends beyond
          our special day.
        </p>
        <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
